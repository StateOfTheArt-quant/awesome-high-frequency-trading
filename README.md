# 1 market microstructure and algorithms trading(execution)

> Market microstructure research primarily focuses on the structure of exchanges and trading venues (e.g. displayed and dark), the price discovery process, determinants of spreads and quotes, intraday trading behavior, and transaction costs

## 1.1 books

[Empirical Market Microstructure](https://www.amazon.com/Empirical-Market-Microstructure-Institutions-Econometrics/dp/0195301641)

> Empirical Market Microstructure is about the institutions that have evolved to handle our trading needs, the economic forces that guide our strategies, and statistical methods of using and interpreting the vast amount of information that these markets produce.

[Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1107091144/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d0_i1)

> In this textbook, the authors develop models for algorithmic trading in contexts such as executing large orders, market making, targeting VWAP and other schedules, trading pairs or collection of assets, and executing in dark pools. These models are grounded on how the exchanges work, whether the algorithm is trading with better informed traders (adverse selection), and the type of information available to market participants at both ultra-high and low frequency. Algorithmic and High-Frequency Trading is the first book that combines sophisticated mathematical modelling, empirical facts and financial economics, taking the reader from basic ideas to cutting-edge research and practice.
